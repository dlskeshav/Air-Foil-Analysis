Title
Airfoil Design Analysis Using XFLR5
Comparative Study of NACA 4412 and NACA 0012 Airfoils

Project Description
This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of two distinct airfoil profiles: NACA 4412 (cambered) and NACA 0012 (symmetric). Using XFLR5 software, we analyze and compare their suitability for low-speed and high-speed aircraft applications respectively. The study focuses on lift, drag, moment coefficients, pressure distribution, and stall behavior over varying angles of attack and Reynolds numbers.

Objectives
Evaluate and quantify the aerodynamic characteristics of NACA 4412 and NACA 0012.

Compare their performance for low-speed and high-speed flight regimes.

Analyze stall behavior and stability metrics.

Provide insights for airfoil selection and aircraft design based on performance data.

Tools Used
XFLR5 v6.61 – for airfoil and wing aerodynamic analysis.

Excel – for graph generation and visualization.

Microsoft Word – for documentation.

Key Results
NACA 4412 demonstrated higher lift and better stall behavior at low speeds, ideal for aircraft requiring short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities.

NACA 0012 exhibited lower drag and better efficiency at high speeds, suitable for high-speed training and combat aircraft.

The project provided a clear comparative performance analysis through lift-drag polars, stall charts, and pressure distribution plots.
