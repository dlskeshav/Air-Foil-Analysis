**Aerodynamic Performance Analysis of NACA 4412 and NACA 0012 Using XFLR5**

## 📚 About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing two renowned airfoil profiles — **NACA 4412** (cambered) and **NACA 0012** (symmetric) — to evaluate their suitability for different flight regimes. Using **XFLR5 software**, we studied the lift, drag, pressure distribution, moment coefficients, and stall characteristics of both airfoils across various angles of attack and Reynolds numbers.

Through a detailed comparative study, we aimed to highlight how airfoil geometry impacts aerodynamic behavior, and guide airfoil selection for low-speed and high-speed aircraft applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Quantify** aerodynamic parameters like lift, drag, and moment coefficients.
- **Compare** airfoil performance under low-speed and high-speed conditions.
- **Analyze** stall behavior and stability through simulations.
- **Generate insights** to assist in optimal airfoil selection for different aircraft types.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **XFLR5 v6.61** – For computational aerodynamic simulations.
- **Microsoft Excel** – For graphing and performance visualization.
- **Microsoft Word** – For report documentation.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **NACA 4412** showed superior lift at low speeds, making it ideal for applications like short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft.
- **NACA 0012** demonstrated minimized drag at higher speeds, suitable for trainer and high-speed flight missions.
- Detailed analysis of stall behavior, pressure distributions, and performance metrics enabled a strong understanding of real-world airfoil applications.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
